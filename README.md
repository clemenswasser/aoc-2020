Hey there! In this repository, you will be able to find my solutions
for this years' [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).

All of my solutions will be **written in Java and/or C++**. You can find an overview of which puzzle I've already solved [here](#solved-puzzles)! In case there are any questions regarding the project, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/niklas2810/aoc-2020/issues/new)!


## Setup Instructions

First off, clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/niklas2810/aoc-2020.git`

**Java:**

1. Make sure you have [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and [Java](https://adoptopenjdk.net) (>= v14) installed and added to your PATH. You can test this by typing `mvn -version` and `java -version` into your terminal.
2. Open the java directory in the IDE of your choice (I'm using IntelliJ) and run it! 
3. Alternatively, build it from your terminal via `mvn package`. You will find an executable named `aoc-2020-1.0-shaded.jar` in the `target` directory.
4. You can execute one of the build scripts as well.

**CPP:**

1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and **clang/g++** (if you are using Windows, you can run the project using WSL, too!). To install the build tools, run: `sudo apt-get install build-essential clang -y`
2. (_Recommended_) You can execute the compile script in the cpp directory: `./compile.sh`. You will be able to find an executable for each day named `day<num>.out`. **This requires clang to be installed.**
3. Alternatively, build the executable from a specific day: `clang++ day<num>.cpp`/`g++ day<num>.cpp`.
4. Execute the file!
