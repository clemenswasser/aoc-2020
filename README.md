Hey there! In this repository, you will be able to find my solutions
for this years' [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).

All of my solutions will be **written in Java and/or C++**. In case there are any questions regarding the project, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/niklas2810/aoc-2020/issues/new)!


## Setup Instructions

First off, clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/niklas2810/aoc-2020.git`

**Java:**

1. Make sure you have [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and [Java](https://adoptopenjdk.net) (>= v14) installed and added to your PATH. You can test this by typing `mvn -version` and `java -version` into your terminal.
2. Open it up in the IDE of your choice (I'm using IntelliJ) and run it! 
3. Alternatively, build it from your terminal via `mvn package`. You will find an executable named `aoc-2020-1.0-shaded.jar` in the `target` directory.
4. You can execute one of the build scripts as well.

**CPP:**

1. Install Visual Studio.
2. Open the `.sln` file in the cpp directory.
3. Build and run the project.
