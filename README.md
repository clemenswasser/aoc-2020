# Advent of Code 2020

Hey there! In this repository, you will be able to find my solutions
for this years' [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).

My entire solutions will be **written in Java**. In case there are any questions regarding the project, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/niklas2810/aoc-2020/issues/new)!


## Setup Instructions

1. Make sure you have [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) installed and added to your PATH. You can test this by typing `mvn -v` into your terminal.
2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/niklas2810/aoc-2020.git`
3. Open it up in the IDE of your choice (I'm using IntelliJ) and run it! Alternatively, build it from your terminal via `mvn package`. You will find an executable named `aoc-2020-1.0-shaded.jar` in the `target` directory.
You can execute one of the build scripts as well.
